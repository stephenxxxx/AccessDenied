Denying access to FATP: Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Pintrest via HOSTS file. For a better life. This file blocks twitter, pintrest, facebook, and most of the tracking sites they use. It is very nice list. 
To use, simply copy [these entries](https://github.com/stephen730/AccessDenied/blob/main/hosts.txt) into your system's host file.  

# ࿈ NEW  
Scripts added. Please place them together with the hosts txt file and build your OWN freshhosts file from your existing hosts file. Please make a copy of your /etc/hosts file to /home/yourusername/hostsfresh  

eg: cp /etc/hosts /home/yourusername/hostsfresh  

Once you have your original hosts file backed up (you might even want to make a backup of the backup) you can run the scripts in the same directory as all the files. Any directory is fine.  

BASH SCRIPTS  
./accessgranted.sh - allows access restoring your orginal hosts file  
./accessdenied.sh - deny access to FATP  

Examples:  

linux: sudo nano /etc/hosts  
windows: c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts (You may have to enable hidden files, please research the proper method)  
Android: /etc/hosts (root required initially)
